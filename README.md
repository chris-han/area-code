# Starter Application

Area Code is a starter repo with all the necessary building blocks for a production ready repository that can be used to build multi-modal applications.

It's built on top of Turborepo. The monorepo contains the following capabilities:

## Apps
- `web`: a Vite app that serves the frontend

## Services
API centric services that power functionality for your applications
- `analytical-service`: Analytical service that powers the analytical functionality for your applications (e.g. analytics, reporting, dashboards, newsfeeds, etc.)
- `retrieval-service`: Retrieval service that powers the retrieval functionality for your applications (e.g. search, recommendations, etc.)
- `transaction-service`: Transaction service that powers the transactional functionality for your applications (e.g. payments, orders, etc.)
- `messaging-service`: Messaging service that powers the messaging functionality for your applications (e.g. chat, notifications, etc.)
- `ai-service`: AI service that powers the AI functionality for your applications (e.g. chat, voice, etc.)

## Packages
- `<library-name>-config`: configuration implementations for specific libraries
- `ui`: a library of shared web UI components

## Future plans
We plan on enabling a user to compose their own application with a subset of the services and packages. We plan on leveraging the `generate` tool provided by turborepo to generate the application code. We also plan on enabling python and other languages based services to be added to the repository.

- Add a `mobile` app that serves the mobile frontend
- Add a `desktop` app that serves the desktop frontend
- Add a `cli` app that serves the command line interface
- Add a `docs` app that serves the documentation
- Add a `blog` app that serves the blog
- Add a `worker` service that enables background processing for the application
- Add a `tests` package that contains shared tests for the repository
- Add a `types` package that contains shared types for the repository
- Add a `utils` package that contains shared utilities for the repository
