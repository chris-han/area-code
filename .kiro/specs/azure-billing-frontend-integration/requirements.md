# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves adding a new frontend page to the ODW (Operational Data Warehouse) Streamlit application that allows users to configure and execute Azure billing workflows, and view the resulting billing data in an interactive table. The page will integrate with the existing Azure billing API connector and provide a user-friendly interface for managing Azure billing data extraction and analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want a dedicated Azure billing page in the frontend application, so that I can access Azure billing functionality through the same interface as other data connectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the application THEN I SHALL see an "Azure Billing" option in the navigation menu under the "Connectors" section
2. WHEN I click on the Azure billing navigation item THEN I SHALL be taken to a dedicated Azure billing page with URL path "azure-billing"
3. WHEN the Azure billing page loads THEN I SHALL see a consistent header and layout matching other connector pages
4. WHEN the page is displayed THEN I SHALL see the Azure billing icon (ðŸ’°) in the navigation menu

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Azure billing workflow parameters through the frontend, so that I can control data extraction settings without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Azure billing page THEN I SHALL see a configuration section with input fields for Azure enrollment number, API key, and date range
2. WHEN I enter configuration values THEN the system SHALL validate the format of enrollment numbers and date ranges
3. WHEN I specify a date range THEN I SHALL be able to select start and end dates using date picker controls
4. WHEN I configure batch size THEN I SHALL see a numeric input with reasonable default and validation limits
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN I SHALL see clear error messages indicating what needs to be corrected

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to trigger Azure billing workflows from the frontend, so that I can initiate data extraction on-demand and monitor the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have valid configuration THEN I SHALL see an enabled "Run Azure Billing Extract" button
2. WHEN I click the extract button THEN the system SHALL trigger the Azure billing Temporal workflow with my configuration parameters
3. WHEN the workflow is running THEN I SHALL see a loading spinner and status message indicating the extraction is in progress
4. WHEN the workflow completes successfully THEN I SHALL see a success message with the number of records processed
5. WHEN the workflow fails THEN I SHALL see an error message with details about what went wrong
6. WHEN the extraction is complete THEN the results table SHALL automatically refresh to show the new data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to view Azure billing data in an interactive table, so that I can analyze cost allocation and resource usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN I SHALL see a table displaying recent Azure billing records with key columns visible
2. WHEN billing data exists THEN the table SHALL show columns for date, subscription, resource, cost, and resource tracking information
3. WHEN I interact with the table THEN I SHALL be able to sort columns, filter data, and search for specific records
4. WHEN there are many records THEN the table SHALL support pagination or virtual scrolling for performance
5. WHEN I select date filters THEN the table SHALL update to show only records within the specified date range
6. WHEN no data is available THEN I SHALL see a helpful message explaining how to extract data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cost center manager, I want to filter and analyze Azure billing data by various dimensions, so that I can understand cost allocation and identify optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the billing data THEN I SHALL see filter controls for subscription, resource group, cost center, and date range
2. WHEN I apply filters THEN the table and any charts SHALL update to reflect the filtered data
3. WHEN I view the data THEN I SHALL see summary metrics showing total cost, number of resources, and top cost drivers
4. WHEN cost data is available THEN I SHALL see a chart visualization showing cost trends over time
5. WHEN resource tracking is applied THEN I SHALL see which resources are mapped to applications and which are unmapped

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data platform operator, I want to monitor Azure billing workflow status and data quality, so that I can ensure the extraction process is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the page THEN I SHALL see the status of the last Azure billing workflow execution
2. WHEN workflows have run THEN I SHALL see metrics showing the number of records extracted, processing time, and any errors
3. WHEN data quality issues exist THEN I SHALL see warnings about missing resource tracking or validation failures
4. WHEN I need to troubleshoot THEN I SHALL see links to view detailed logs and audit information
5. WHEN the system detects issues THEN I SHALL see recommendations for resolving common problems

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want Azure API credentials to be handled securely in the frontend, so that sensitive information is protected while allowing reuse for subsequent workflow runs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter API credentials THEN the input fields SHALL be masked to prevent shoulder surfing
2. WHEN I choose to save credentials THEN they SHALL be encrypted and stored securely for reuse in future workflow runs
3. WHEN I return to the page THEN I SHALL have the option to use previously saved credentials or enter new ones
4. WHEN credentials are stored THEN they SHALL not be visible in browser storage or logs in plain text
5. WHEN credentials are invalid THEN error messages SHALL not expose the actual credential values
6. WHEN I want to clear saved credentials THEN I SHALL see a "Clear Saved Credentials" option
7. WHEN the application detects security risks THEN it SHALL automatically clear stored credentials and notify the user

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Azure billing page to integrate seamlessly with the existing application architecture, so that I have a consistent experience across all connector pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the Azure billing page THEN it SHALL follow the same design patterns and styling as other connector pages
2. WHEN I trigger workflows THEN they SHALL use the same status message system as other connectors
3. WHEN I view data THEN the table SHALL use the same styling and interaction patterns as other data views
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed using the same error handling system as other pages
5. WHEN I navigate between pages THEN the Azure billing page SHALL maintain the same performance and responsiveness
