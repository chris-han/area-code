# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the standard patterns and practices for integrating frontend applications with Moose-based backend APIs. The goal is to establish consistent, reliable API integration patterns that prevent common issues like incorrect HTTP methods, missing timeouts, and port configuration errors.

## Glossary

- **Moose Service**: The backend data processing service that exposes consumption APIs
- **Consumption API**: REST endpoints exposed by Moose for data retrieval and workflow triggering
- **Frontend Client**: Any application (Streamlit, React, etc.) that consumes Moose APIs
- **API Integration Layer**: The abstraction layer in frontend applications that handles API communication

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want standardized API integration patterns, so that I can reliably connect to Moose services without configuration errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with Moose APIs, THE Frontend Client SHALL use the correct HTTP method for each endpoint type
2. WHEN making API requests, THE Frontend Client SHALL include appropriate timeout configurations to prevent hanging connections
3. WHEN configuring API endpoints, THE Frontend Client SHALL use the standard port 4200 with proper error handling for unavailable ports
4. WHERE API endpoints require parameters, THE Frontend Client SHALL use query parameters for GET requests and JSON payloads for POST requests
5. WHEN API requests fail, THE Frontend Client SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent port configuration across all services, so that I can reliably manage and troubleshoot the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Moose Service SHALL always run on port 4200 for consumption APIs
2. WHEN port 4200 is unavailable, THE System SHALL issue warnings instead of automatically switching to alternative ports
3. THE Frontend Client SHALL never fallback to port 4201 without explicit configuration
4. WHEN port conflicts occur, THE System SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
5. THE API Integration Layer SHALL validate port availability before making requests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documented API patterns, so that I can avoid common integration mistakes and follow established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API Integration Layer SHALL follow documented HTTP method conventions for each endpoint type
2. WHEN implementing new API integrations, THE Developer SHALL reference the established patterns
3. THE System SHALL provide examples of correct API usage for common scenarios
4. WHEN API patterns change, THE Documentation SHALL be updated to reflect new conventions
5. THE Integration Layer SHALL include validation to prevent incorrect HTTP method usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I want robust error handling, so that users receive helpful feedback when API operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests timeout, THE Frontend Client SHALL display user-friendly timeout messages
2. WHEN authentication fails, THE Frontend Client SHALL provide clear authentication error guidance
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded, THE Frontend Client SHALL inform users about retry timing
4. WHEN server errors occur, THE Frontend Client SHALL distinguish between temporary and permanent failures
5. THE Error Handling System SHALL log detailed error information for debugging while showing simplified messages to users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want consistent API testing patterns, so that I can verify integrations work correctly across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API Integration Layer SHALL include built-in connection testing capabilities
2. WHEN testing API endpoints, THE System SHALL validate both connectivity and response format
3. THE Testing Framework SHALL support both mock and live API testing scenarios
4. WHEN API changes are deployed, THE System SHALL automatically validate existing integrations
5. THE Integration Tests SHALL cover timeout scenarios, error conditions, and success paths
