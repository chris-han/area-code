# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves designing and implementing a new Azure billing API connector that integrates with the existing ODW (Operational Data Warehouse) ETL architecture. The connector will extract Azure billing data from the Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA) API, transform it according to business rules, and load it into ClickHouse staging and fact tables. The implementation should follow the established connector pattern used by existing blob, logs, and events connectors while incorporating the specific Azure billing logic from the existing Python implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want a standardized Azure billing connector that integrates with the Temporal workflow engine, so that I can extract Azure billing data using the same orchestration patterns as other data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the connector is instantiated THEN it SHALL implement the same extract() interface as existing connectors (BlobConnector, LogsConnector, EventsConnector)
2. WHEN the connector is created through ConnectorFactory THEN it SHALL accept an AzureBillingConnectorConfig with batch_size, date_range, and API credentials
3. WHEN the connector extracts data THEN it SHALL return a list of Pydantic models representing Azure billing records
4. WHEN the connector is used in Temporal workflows THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing workflow orchestration patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the Azure billing connector to extract comprehensive billing data from the Azure EA API, so that I can analyze cost allocation and resource usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the connector fetches data THEN it SHALL retrieve all billing detail fields including account information, subscription details, meter data, costs, and resource metadata
2. WHEN API pagination is encountered THEN the connector SHALL handle nextLink pagination automatically to retrieve complete datasets
3. WHEN API rate limits or temporary failures occur THEN the connector SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN date ranges are specified THEN the connector SHALL fetch data for the requested month periods using the Azure EA API format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want the Azure billing data to be transformed with proper resource tracking and tagging, so that I can accurately allocate costs to applications and cost centers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN billing records are processed THEN the connector SHALL apply resource tracking patterns from the d_application_tag table
2. WHEN multiple resource tracking matches are found THEN the connector SHALL prioritize matches based on instance_id, resource_group, and subscription_guid hierarchy
3. WHEN JSON fields (tags, additional_info) are processed THEN the connector SHALL parse and extract structured data for cost center allocation
4. WHEN VM-specific logic is applied THEN the connector SHALL derive SKU, resource names, and VM names according to business rules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data platform operator, I want the Azure billing connector to handle data quality and error scenarios gracefully, so that the ETL pipeline remains robust and provides visibility into data issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data validation fails THEN the connector SHALL log detailed error information and continue processing valid records
2. WHEN resource tracking conflicts occur THEN the connector SHALL generate audit logs for manual review
3. WHEN API responses contain malformed data THEN the connector SHALL handle JSON parsing errors and skip invalid records
4. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the connector SHALL implement memory monitoring and garbage collection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Azure billing connector to be configurable and maintainable, so that I can adjust API endpoints, credentials, and processing parameters without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the connector is configured THEN it SHALL accept Azure enrollment number, API key, and endpoint URL through configuration
2. WHEN batch processing is configured THEN the connector SHALL support configurable batch sizes for memory management
3. WHEN date ranges are specified THEN the connector SHALL validate and process start_date and end_date parameters
4. WHEN the connector runs THEN it SHALL provide structured logging compatible with the existing logging framework

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want the Azure billing connector to integrate with the existing ClickHouse data warehouse, so that billing data flows through the established ingest and transform pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is extracted THEN the connector SHALL format records for compatibility with the existing ingest API endpoints
2. WHEN staging tables are used THEN the connector SHALL support the existing stg_azure_billing_detail table schema
3. WHEN fact tables are populated THEN the connector SHALL generate data compatible with the f_azure_billing_detail table structure
4. WHEN the connector completes THEN it SHALL provide row count validation and data quality metrics
