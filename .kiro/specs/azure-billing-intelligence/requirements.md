5. WHILE workflows are running, THE ABI_System SHALL allow users to cancel or retry failed workflows through the interface

### Requirement 5: Data Visualization and Reporting

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want to display data retrieved from ClickHouse by Azure billing workflows, so that I can visualize cost trends and make informed financial decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN billing data is available, THE React_Frontend SHALL display interactive dashboards with cost breakdowns by service, resource group, and subscription
2. WHEN users apply filters, THE React_Frontend SHALL update visualizations in real-time without page refresh
