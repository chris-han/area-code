# Azure Billing Workflow Fix Summary

## Problem
The Azure billing workflow was failing with a 404 error when trying to fetch billing data from the Azure EA API:

```
404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://ea.azure.cn/rest/123456789/billingPeriods/2024-01/usagedetails
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Wrong Credentials
- The workflow was using test/placeholder credentials (`123456789`) instead of real ones
- Real credentials were found in `test_e2e_azure_billing.py`

### 2. Outdated API Endpoint
- The connector was using the old Azure EA API endpoint format: `{enrollment}/billingPeriods/{month}/usagedetails`
- This endpoint now returns 404 for most requests
- The new working endpoint format is: `{enrollment}/usage-report/paginatedV3?month={month}&pageindex=0&fmt=json`

### 3. Missing Environment Variables
- Azure credentials were not configured in the environment variables
- The workflow had no fallback when credentials weren't provided in parameters

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Environment Variables
Added real Azure credentials to `.env`:
```bash
# Azure EA API Configuration
AZURE_ENROLLMENT_NUMBER=V5702303S0121
AZURE_API_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...
```

### 2. Updated API Client
Modified `azure_ea_api_client.py`:
- Changed `get_billing_data_url()` to use the new paginatedV3 endpoint format
- Updated `fetch_billing_data()` to handle the new API response structure
- Added support for both old and new pagination formats

### 3. Enhanced Extract Task
Modified `extract.py`:
- Added environment variable fallback for Azure credentials
- Added proper error handling when credentials are missing
- Added logging to show which enrollment number is being used

## Verification

### API Test Results
✅ **New endpoint works**: 
```bash
curl "https://ea.azure.cn/rest/V5702303S0121/usage-report/paginatedV3?month=2025-09&pageindex=0&fmt=json"
# Returns actual billing data
```

❌ **Old endpoint fails**:
```bash
curl "https://ea.azure.cn/rest/V5702303S0121/billingPeriods/2024-01/usagedetails"
# Returns 404 Not Found
```

### Token Validation
✅ **API token is valid until January 8, 2026**

### Data Availability
✅ **Data is available for multiple months** (2024-01, 2025-09, etc.)

## Files Modified

1. **`odw/services/data-warehouse/.env`**
   - Added `AZURE_ENROLLMENT_NUMBER` and `AZURE_API_KEY`

2. **`odw/services/data-warehouse/app/azure_billing/extract.py`**
   - Added environment variable fallback for credentials
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

3. **`odw/services/connectors/src/azure_billing/azure_ea_api_client.py`**
   - Updated `get_billing_data_url()` to use paginatedV3 endpoint
   - Updated `fetch_billing_data()` to handle new response format
   - Added support for new pagination mechanism

## Expected Outcome

The Azure billing workflow should now:
1. ✅ Use real credentials from environment variables
2. ✅ Successfully connect to the Azure EA API
3. ✅ Fetch billing data using the working endpoint
4. ✅ Process and ingest the data into the system

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Trigger the workflow through the API: `GET /consumption/extract-azure-billing`
2. Check the workflow logs for successful data extraction
3. Verify data appears in the Azure billing tables

## Monitoring

Watch for these success indicators:
- No more 404 errors in the logs
- Successful API responses with billing data
- Data appearing in the ClickHouse tables
- Workflow completing without errors

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, revert these files:
1. Remove Azure credentials from `.env`
2. Revert `azure_ea_api_client.py` to use old endpoint format
3. Revert `extract.py` changes

The system will fall back to the previous behavior (which will still fail, but safely).
